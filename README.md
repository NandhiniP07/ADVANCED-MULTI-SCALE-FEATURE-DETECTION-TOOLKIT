# Advanced Multi-Scale Feature Detection Toolkit

## Overview
This project implements a complete **image processing pipeline from scratch using NumPy** to detect and enhance visual features. It demonstrates fundamental computer vision techniques without relying on OpenCV’s high-level functions.

---

## Pipeline Stages
- **Edge Detection:** Sobel operator for horizontal and vertical edges
- **Feature Enhancement:** Laplacian-based image sharpening
- **Corner Detection:** Harris corner detection with Gaussian smoothing
- **Blob Detection:** Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) with local maxima filtering

---

## Key Highlights
- Manual convolution implementation
- Multi-scale feature analysis
- Visual comparison with OpenCV built-in methods
- Clear visualization of edges, corners, and blobs

---

## Conclusion
The toolkit validates that **core feature detection algorithms can be accurately implemented from scratch**, closely matching OpenCV results while strengthening understanding of computer vision fundamentals.
